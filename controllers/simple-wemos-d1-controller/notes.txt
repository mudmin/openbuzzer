This is a very simple "receiver" for the buzzers I made in my Part 1 video on the project. If you don't want to connect to the cloud, you can connect to this receiver.  Note that all the buzzers and the receiver require wifi.

The code itself is your guide on how to build this receiver.  It's a couple of LEDs and a couple of buttons and the code tells you what goes where.
